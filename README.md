# Contact Form with JavaScript Validation
This is a simple contact form created as part of a web development learning project. The form includes fields for Name, Email, and Message with client-side validation using JavaScript. It provides instant feedback to users about input errors and shows a success message when the form is filled out correctly.

## Features
- Validates that Name and Message are not empty
- Checks if Email is in a valid format using a regular expression
- Displays clear error messages below each input if the validation fails

- Shows a confirmation message on successful submission (no actual data is sent)
- Styled with basic CSS for a clean and simple look

## How to Use
- Open the HTML file in any modern browser like Chrome
- Fill in the form fields and click Submit
- If any inputs are incorrect, error messages will be shown immediately
- Correct inputs to see a success confirmation

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
